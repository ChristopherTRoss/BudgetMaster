### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Purpose
  The product is a budgeting Android application that allows users to easily keep track of budgets and 
    day-to-day spending. Users may enter their monthly income and divide it into smaller expense 
    categories (e.g. entertainment, gas, groceries, etc.). The application will provide an 
    intuitive user interface and a budget analysis to encourage users to keep track of their spending.
    
#### 1.2 Scope
BudgetMaster is an Android application that will be compatible on all versions past Android 5.0. BudgetMaster will allow its users to log all incomes and expenses by category and project the monthly available income on its main screen. The mobile application will help the user budget their income properly in order to reach the goal of the user which is to not overspend their money. BudgetMaster aims to be a frequently used application that encourages the management of finances on a daily basis.

### 2. Main System Architecture
  - Our application will be mainly operating within four main components.  Those components are the user, budgets, categories, and transactions.  The user entity will mainly consist of the user's login information and how to user will login.  The user will also have the ability to input data such as categories and transactions.  The next three entities are part of the budgeting process.  These entities will keep track of user-inputted data and allow the user to view what they are spending their money on.

### 6. Physical View

### 7. Database View
  The application will use an embedded sqlite database in order to keep track of data of all transactions and account details.  The database will be stored locally on the application so that the user can always access the data, even without internet connection.  The main focus of this database to ensure all transactions get placed under a category, and that all categories are placed in a budget, so that are the various sorts and filters the application would use will be made easier.
