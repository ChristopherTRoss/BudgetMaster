### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Purpose
  The product is a budgeting Android application that allows users to easily keep track of budgets and 
    day-to-day spending. Users may enter their monthly income and divide it into smaller expense 
    categories (e.g. entertainment, gas, groceries, etc.). The application will provide an 
    intuitive user interface and a budget analysis to encourage users to keep track of their spending.
    
#### 1.2 Scope

BudgetMaster will allow its users to log all incomes and expenses by category and project the monthly available income on its main screen. The mobile application will help the user budget their income properly in order to reach the goal of the user which is to not overspend their money. BudgetMaster aims to be a frequently used application that encourages the management of finances on a daily basis.
