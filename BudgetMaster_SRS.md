### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Purpose
  The product is a budgeting Android application that allows users to easily keep track of budgets and 
    day-to-day spending. Users may enter their monthly income and divide it into smaller expense 
    categories (e.g. entertainment, gas, groceries, etc.). The application will provide an 
    intuitive user interface and a budget analysis to encourage users to keep track of their spending.

### 2. Overall Description
#### 2.1 Product Perspective

This system will be a mobile application that allows users to make and track their budget; it will also include a database that allows the storage of data of the budget.
<br>
The database and the mobile application will need to interact in order for the user of the app to see and track what money has been spent in prior entries. Whenever the user makes an entry into the mobile application, the database will then update its information about the user's current budget. If the user wants to see past entries in the mobile application, the database will have to provide the application with that information so that the application can then show the user the information about the budget requested. So, the mobile application will be able to both access and modify data of the database. The database will be embedded in the mobile application in order for the user to access the database easily.
<br>

#### 2.2 Product Functions

- The mobile application will allow the users to create a PIN number at the login screen.
- The mobile application must let the users add, edit, and remove entries of money spent or earned, along with selecting a category for each expense.
- The mobile application will allow the users to add different types of incomes to their budget, either recurring or non-recurring.
- The mobile application must let the users add different categories to their budget (e.g. food, gas, etc.)
- The mobile application will allow users to allocate how much money they want to spend in a given month into their categories, and provide information throughout the month about how much money they have left to spend in each given category.
- The mobile application will give the user a budget analysis that will help save money and stay under their budget.


#### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

The only user class in this system is the standard mobile application user. The user will need to input all of his expenses and incomes, and the application will store those in the database. All of the requirements will be pertinent to the mobile application user. 
<br>
A prerequisite for the users is first that they own a smartphone with an Android operating system. User classes will primarily target those with enough income and expenses that it would benefit to keep track of this information. For example, a college student would benefit from this app because most college-aged students have jobs and frequent expenses, and college students are also relatively new to managing their own expenses. Further, an adult with several bills and other expenses may want to keep track of this information as well.  

#### 2.4 Operating Environment

The application will only be able to run on mobile phones. More specifically, this application will only run on Android mobile devices that are on version 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher. This application is stand-alone, so no other software should interact with it. 

#### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

In wanting to make the database (SQLite) accessible at all times, the database is embedded in the system, so that no internet connection is needed in order to access it.  However, this creates a constraint that all data is stored on the mobile application, so if the user were to delete the app or lose their mobile device, all information in the database would be lost.  Future implementations may add a back-up feature to prevent the loss of data.

There are some constraints on the usability of this application due to security concerns. The app would be most appealing if it only took a few seconds for a user to open the app and make an entry, but for security reasons we must include a login system in the event that a user’s phone is stolen and has sensitive information stored on the app. The best compromise we can make is a PIN system rather than a username/password system. Additionally, the system must logout the user automatically if they leave it idle for an extended period of time; this functionality may annoy some users, but is a necessary feature for ensuring security.

In order to reach the deadline on time, the developers of BudgetMaster will also have to limit platform compatibility. It would require too much time to transform the code into an iOS compatible format and as a result the product will only be available for Androids.

#### 2.6 User Documentation

BudgetMaster strives to have an intuitive user-interface that should present itself in a way that any function will be visible to the user. By following the Material Design guidelines provided by Google, BudgetMaster should have a user-experience that any Android user should be familiar with.

#### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies

This system makes the assumption that there is enough storage and space on the mobile device of the user to store all the information inputted into the database. If the mobile phone runs out of storage or memory, then the database may not be able to save and keep track information entered. 
<br>
This system also depends on the honesty of the user. There is no administrator to check and verify your incomes and expenses, so one could input various amounts into the system. In that case, the application would not succeed in its goal to help the user keep his or her budget. Further, a user may input an incorrect value that could cause incorrect estimations to a spendable income for the user.
<br>
The system assumes that the user will remember their PIN after creating their account. If the user forgets their PIN, they will not be able to access their account. 


<br>


### 3. External Interface Requirements
#### 3.1 User Interfaces

The screen the user is directed to upon opening the app will ask the user to enter their PIN to login, along with a button for resetting the PIN. If it is the first use of the app, the screen will instead ask for a PIN to be created and then take the user to the security questions page.
<br>
There will be a sidebar menu accessible by swiping from the left on all pages once logged in that lists “Home”, “Transaction Log”, “Analysis”, “Security Questions”, and “Logout,” either taking the user to the respective page or in the case of logout, logging out and returning the user to the login page. 
<br>
The home screen that is displayed upon logging in will display the total spendable income the user has for the remainder of the month. This page will contain a list of categories showing how much has been spent so far in each category and what the category’s maximum limit is set to. There will be a floating action button in the bottom right corner for adding categories, incomes, and expenses. If the user holds down on a category, a floating menu will open asking the user to specify whether they would like to edit or remove it.
<br>
The transaction log screen will show all expenses and incomes, with a sort button to allow the user to sort by date, category, or amount. On this page, the user may press and hold on its corresponding log, which will invoke a floating menu asking the user to specify whether they would like to edit or remove it.
<br>
The analysis screen will list all categories and show how close the user came to reaching their maximum limit in each category.
<br> 
The security questions screen will list six empty boxes for entering three security questions and three answers with a submit button at the bottom.


#### 3.2 Hardware Interfaces

All android devices with version 5.0 or higher should be supported by the app. The data that the user inputs will be stored locally on the phone in an SQLite database.

#### 3.3 Software Interfaces

BudgetMaster will use the Material Design library (XML/Java) that is provided through Android Studio for Android devices with version 5.0 and higher. The database will be implemented using SQLite. Refer to Section 1.5 for links.

#### 3.4 Communications Interfaces

The application will have no outside communication with servers. All methods of storage will be done locally, and as a result the only communication will be between the application, the SQLite database, and the Android hardware. When the application is started, data will be pulled from the SQLite database stored locally on the system hardware.

<br>

### 4. System Features 
#### 4.1 Add Income
  1. Description - User adds an amount that increases total spendable income - High Priority
  2. Stimulus/Response Sequences - User will click on a floating action button on the bottom right of the home screen whenever the user wishes to add an income.  The action button will then prompt the user to select if they are adding a category, expense or income.  The user will select income. The application will then prompt the user to enter the amount of the income. The user can also enter an optional description of the income listed.  The user will also select whether this is a recurring or non-recurring income.  Non-recurring will be the default selected option. If the user selects recurring income, the system will also prompt the user to enter how often it recurs (i.e. weekly, monthly, etc.)  After the user has entered in all this information, they will hit a submit button at the bottom of the screen to confirm changes. If the user selected a non-recurring income, then it updates the amount for the income category and adds the amount into the user's total budget amount, updating the database and creating a transaction log with the date, description, and price of the income, as well a whether or not it recurs. If the user leaves any field blank besides the description, then it will not update the database, and tell the user that there are required fields missing.  Once a valid entry is made by the user, the database will be updated.
  3. Functional Requirements - 4.14 (Verify PIN), 4.7 (Create Category)

#### 4.2 Add Expense
  1. Description - User adds an amount that will decrease the total expendable income - High Priority
  2. Stimulus/Response Sequences - User will select the floating action button in the bottom-right corner of the home screen. The action button will then prompt the user to select if they are adding a category, expense or income. Upon selecting expense, the user will be prompted to enter a title, category, an amount, and an optional description for the expense. The user will need to specify whether or not the payment is recurring. The application will default to non-recurring, however if the payment is recurring, the user will need to specify if the expense is weekly, biweekly, or monthly. After the user has entered in all this information, they will hit a submit button at the bottom of the screen to confirm changes. If the user selected a non-recurring income, then it updates the amount spent in the specified category and subtracts the amount from the user's total budget amount, creating a transaction log with the date, category, description, and price of the income, as well as whether or not it recurs. If the user leaves any field blank besides the description, then it will not update the database, and tell the user that there are required fields missing. Once a valid entry is made, the database will be updated.

The application will have gas, rent, food, electricity, and miscellaneous categories created by default if this is the first time the user has visited this page. There is only one category for incomes, which will be included by default and named “Income.” Then the user will press the floating action button in the bottom right corner of the screen, asking if they would like to “Create Category”, “Add Income”, or “Add Expense.” Upon selecting “Create Category”, the system will prompt them to enter in the name of the new category and the maximum amount of money the user is willing to allocate for this category in a month. Once the user is done typing in a name and amount, they will press a submit button. If the entry has any blank information, then the system will not update the database and will prompt the user to enter valid information. Once valid information is entered, the system will add the category to the database and then update the home screen with the new category.

  2. When the user wants to view his logs for a certain category, he can do this in two different ways.  The first way is by tapping on the category from the home screen.  This action will bring the user to the transaction log and then automatically sort it by the category that was pressed.  The logs will be pulled from the database where the category matches the one originally clicked.  It will show a detailed view of each log with title, date, description, and amount of expense sorted by the most recent listed first. The second way to perform this action will be located inside the transaction log.  When the user is in the transaction log, the user may click a sort button and then select the "by category" option.  This will perform the same system action that occurs after pressing a category from the home screen.

     1. Rationale: The user will need to protect their personal spending information from being accessible to others.
<br>
     2. Description: On opening the application, the user will undergo the login process to ensure that his personal spending information will be secure. There will be security questions in place in order to reset the PIN if it is lost. To ensure account security, the application will force logout the user upon application termination, and will also force logout the user upon having the application on idle for thirty minutes. The user will additionally have the option to manually logout.

#### 5.4 Software Quality Attributes
  1. Maintainability and Extendibility  <br>
     1. Rationale: The system will be made in a phase development so it needs to be maintainable so new features can be added easily.
<br>
     2. Description: The application should be made in a way that allows future functions to be added without disrupting the previous existing functions. 
<br>
  2. Reliability 
<br>
     1. Rationale: The system will perform exactly to the specifications listed in the development process.
<br>
     2. Description: The data entries should be added in exactly as the user specifies them without any mathematical errors or incorrect data such as the wrong description, title, or category. If one-hundred entries are added, every entry should show the correct data as specified by the user.
<br>
  3. Usability
<br>
     1. Rationale: This application should be designed to be easy to use in order to encourage users to keep track on the spendings regularly. 
<br>
     2. Description: In order to make the application more user-friendly, the home screen will be accessible by clicking the back button on the current screen by at most 2 times after the user logs in. 
<br>
    
#### 5.5 Business Rules

There are no classifications between different types of users, so all users have equal access to different features of the app.

### 6. Other Requirements

### Appendix A: Glossary
- Mobile Application - a type of application software designed to run on a mobile device
- Income - money received, especially on a regular basis, for work or through investments
- Expense - the cost required for something; the money spent on something
- PIN (Personal Identification Number) - a numeric password used to authenticate a user to a system
- Security Question - questions to authenticate customers to provide an additional layer of security
- Home screen - the page the user is directed to after logging in which contains the balance and the categories.

### Appendix B: Analysis Models

### Appendix C: To Be Determined List
  1. Although we are using a PIN number system, the team is still considering the option of using usernames and passwords instead to make the application more secure and lower the risk of the user’s financial information being compromised. The advantages of a password system is that there are more combinations and therefore it is more secure. The advantages of the current PIN system is that it is quicker to login, making the application more accessible. Currently we think accessibility is more important considering that the application will require regular usage to be helpful to the user, does not contain any actual payment information, and only stores data locally.
  2. We may implement a backup feature in the future so that data can be maintained across multiple devices or upon losing a device. Currently we do not have the resources for this as we do not have access to a server and our application is handled entirely offline.
