### __2.   Overall Description__ 
#### __2.1   Product Perspective__

This system will be a mobile application that allows users to make and track their budget; it will also include a database that allows the storage of data of the budget.
<br>
The database and the mobile application will need to interact in order for the user of the app to see and track what money has been spent in prior entries. Whenever the user makes an entry into the mobile application, the database will then update its information about the user's current budget. If the user wants to see past entries in the mobile application, the database will have to provide the application with that information so that the application can then show the user the information about the budget requested. So, the mobile application will be able to both access and modify data of the database. The database will be embedded in the mobile application in order for the user to access the database easily.


#### __2.2   Product Functions__

- The mobile application will allow the users to create a PIN number at the login screen.
- The mobile application must let the users add and edit entries of money spent, along with selecting a category of what the purchase falls under.
- The mobile application will allow the users to add different types of incomes to their budget.
- The mobile application must let the users add different categories to their budget (e.g. food, gas, etc.)
- The mobile application will allow users to allocate how much money they want to spend in a given month into their categories, and provide information throughout the month about how much money they have left to spend in each given category.
- The mobile application will give the user tips and goals to complete that will help save money and stay under their budget.


#### __2.3   User Classes and Characteristics__

The only user class in this system is the standard mobile application user. The user will need to input all of his expenses and incomes, and the application will store those in the database. All of the requirements will be pertinent to the mobile application user. 
<br>
A prerequisite for the users is first that they own a smartphone with an Android operating system. User classes will primarily target those with enough income and expenses that it would benefit to keep track of this information. For example, a college student would benefit from this app because most college-aged students have jobs and frequent expenses, and college students are also relatively new to managing their own expenses. Further, an adult with several bills and other expenses may want to keep track of this information as well.  

#### __2.4   Operating Environment__

The application will only be able to run on mobile phones. More specifically, this application will only run on Android mobile devices that are on version 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher. This application is stand alone, so no other software should interact with it. 

#### __2.5   Design and Implementation Constraints__

In wanting to make the database accessible at all times, the database is embedded in the system, so that no internet connection is needed in order to access it.  However, this creates a constraint that all data is stored on the mobile application, so if the user were to delete the app or lose their mobile device, all information on the database would be lost.  Future implementations may add a back-up feature to prevent the loss of data.

#### __2.6   User Documentation__

BudgetMaster strives to have an intuitive user-interface that should present itself in a way that any function will be visible to the user. By following the Material Design guidelines provided by Google, BudgetMaster should have a user-experience that any Android user should be familiar with.

#### __2.7   Assumptions and Dependencies__

This system makes the assumption that there is enough storage and space on the mobile device of the user to store all the information inputted into the database. If the mobile phone runs out of storage or memory, then the database may not be able to save and keep track information entered. 
<br>
This system also depends on the honesty of the user. There is no administrator to check and verify your incomes and expenses, so one could input various amounts into the system. In that case, the application would not succeed in its goal to help the user keep his or her budget. Further, a user may input an incorrect value that could cause incorrect estimations to a spendable income for the user.
<br>
The system assumes that the user will remember their PIN after creating their account. If the user forgets their PIN, they will not be able to access their account.
<br>

### __3.   External Interface Requirements__ 
#### __3.1   User Interfaces__

The screen the user is directed to upon opening the app will display the total spendable income the user has for the remainder of the month. The initial page will allow you to view a log of recent incomes and expenses by scrolling down. By selecting each item, a more detailed view of the income or expense will appear as a floating menu. 
<br>
There will be an additional screen that will allow users to view all expenses and incomes, and allow the user to sort by date, category, or net amount. 
<br>
To edit or remove an income/expense, the user may press and hold on its corresponding log, which will invoke a floating menu asking the user to specify whether or not they would like to edit or remove just this instance or all previous instances of the selected item.

#### __3.2   Hardware Interfaces__

All android devices with version 5.0 or higher should be supported by the app. The data that the user inputs will be stored locally on the phone in an SQLite database.

#### __3.3   Software Interfaces__

BudgetMaster will use the Material Design library (XML/Java) that is provided through Android Studio for Android devices with version 5.0 and higher. The database will be implemented using SQLite.

#### __3.4   Communications Interfaces__

<br>

### __4.   System Features__ 
#### __4.1   Add Income__
  1. Descritpion - User adds an amount that increases total spendable income - High Priority
  2. Stimulus/Response Sequences - User will click on an action button on the bottom of the home screen whenever the user wishes to add an income.  They action button will then prompt the user to select if they are adding an expense or an income.  The user will select income. The application will then prompt the user to enter the amount of the income and select which category the income falls under. The user can also enter an optional description of the income listed.  The user will also select whether this is a regularly reoccuring and non-reoccuring income.  Non-reoccuring will be the defaulty selected option. If the user selects reoccuring income, the system will also prompt the user to enter how reoccuring it is (i.e. weekly, monthly, etc.)  After the user has entered in all this information, they will hit a submit button at the bottom of the screen to confirm changes.  Then the system will update the database based on what the user inputted.  If the user selected a non-reoccuring income, then it adds the amount into the user's total budget amount and adds a log into the database with the date, category, description, and price of the income.  Then the application makes the log appears on the home screen.  If the user leaves any field blank besides the description, then it will not update the database, and tell the user that there are required fields missing.

The user will need to specify whether or not the payment is recurring. The application will default to recurring, however if the payment is recurring, the user will need to specify if the expense is weekly, biweekly, or monthly. After the user has entered in all this information, they will hit a submit button at the bottom of the screen to confirm changes. Then the system will update the database based on what the user inputted. If the user selected a non-reoccuring income, then it adds the amount into the user's total budget amount and adds a log into the database with the date, category, description, and price of the income. Then the application makes the log appears on the home screen.

Then, the user will open up the side-swipe menu and select the option “Security Questions”. There it will display their security questions and answers.  Each question and answer will be in a text editable field, so the user can then update any changes they want.  Once the user is done changing their questions and answers, they can hit a confirm button at the bottom of the screen and it will update the questions and answers in the database.  If the user tries to save an empty field in their security questions and answers, then the application will not update the database and will inform the user that they cannot leave any fields blank.

#### __4.18   View Analysis__
  1. Description - The application will provide users information about their spending habits to help them be more efficient.  Low Priority
  2. Stimulus/Response Sequences - In order to access the page with the budget analysis, the user must be logged in and at the home screen.

The categories that they spent the most in will be at the top, with the categories they spent the least in being at the bottom. 

#### __4.19   Sort Logs by Amount__
  1. Description - Users must be able to sort their incomes and expenses by the amount. Medium Priority
  2. Stimulus/Response Sequences - When the user wants to sort their incomes and expenses by the amounts, they will open the transaction log. Once there, the user will click on the sort button and select the “By amount” option. The user will then be prompted to choose if they just want to see incomes, expenses, or both, and also select if they want it to sort in with the largest amounts at the top or the smallest amounts.  It then will display all these logs in a detailed format with title, date, description, category, and amount.

#### __4.20   Sort Logs by Category__
  1. Description - Users must be able to see all their expenses for thier certain categories. 
  2. When the user wants to view his logs for a certain category, he can do this two different ways.  The first way, is by clicking on the category when it is displayed on the home screen.  This action will bring the user to the transaction log and then automatically sort it by the category that was originally clicked.  The logs will be pulled from the database where the category matches the one originally clicked.  It will show a detailed view of each log with title, date, description, and amount of expense sorted by the most recent listed first. The second way to perform this action will be located inside the transaction log.  When the user is in the transaction log, the user may click a sort button and then select the "by category" option.  This will perform the same action as the previous way to do it. 

#### __4.21   Sort Logs by Date__
  1. Description - Users must be able to view their expenses and incomes by their date entered. Medium Priority
  2. Stimulus/Response Sequences - When the user wants to sort their incomes and expenses by the date entered, they will open the transaction log. The user will click on the sort button and select the “By date” option.  The user will then be prompted to choose if they just want to see incomes, expenses, or both, and also select if they want it to be ordered starting with the most recent entries or by the oldest entries. It then will display all these logs in a detailed format with title, date, description, category, and amount.

### __5.   Other Nonfunctional Requirements__ 
#### __5.1   Performance Requirements__
  1. Data Entry Performance
<br>
     Rationale: The data put in by the user must be put in the system fast enough for the user to still use the system.
<br>
     Description: When the user enters in his an income our expense, their budget should update within 2 seconds of confirming the input.
<br>
     Ref:
<br>

#### __5.2   Safety Requirements__

Someone could potentially make a poor financial decision based on inaccurate information if they do not enter all of their expenses as expected by the program. In addition, the user’s financial information may be at risk if a user logs in with someone else’s PIN causing their financial security to be at risk.


#### __5.3   Security Requirements__
  1. Account Login Security
<br>
     Rationale: The user will need to protect their personal spending information from being accessible to others.
<br>
     Description: On opening the application, the user will undergo the login process to ensure that his personal spending information will be secure.  To ensure account security, the application will force logout the user upon application termination, and will also force logout the user upon having the application on idle for more than one hour.  The user will also have the option to force logout.
<br>
     Ref: Login FR
<br>

#### __5.4   Software Quality Attributes__
  1. Maintainability and Extendability  <br>
     Rationale: The system will be made in a phase development so it needs to be maintainable so new features can be added easily.
<br>
     Description: The application should be made in a way that allows future functions to be added without disrupting the previous existing functions. 
<br>
  2. Reliability 
<br>
     Rationale: The system will perform exactly to the specifications listed in the development process.
<br>
     Description: The data entries should be added in correctly. By adding one-hundred data entries, the success rate should be ninety-nine percent accurate.
<br>
  3. Usability
<br>
     Rationale: This application should be designed to be easy to use in order to encourage users to keep track on the spendings regularly. 
<br>
     Description: In order to make the application more user-friendly, the home screen will be accessible by clicking the back button on the current screen by at most 2 times after the user logs in. 
<br>
    
#### __5.5   Business Rules__ 

There are no classifications between different types of users, so all users have equal access to different features of the app.

<br>

### __6.   Other Requirements__

### __Appendix A: Glossary__
- Mobile Application - a type of application software designed to run on a mobile device
- Income - money received, especially on a regular basis, for work or through investments
- Expense - the cost required for something; the money spent on something
- PIN (Personal Identification Number) - a numeric password used to authenticate a user to a system
- Security Question - questions to authenticate customers to provide an additional layer of security

### __Appendix B: Analysis Models__

### __Appendix C: To Be Determined List__
  1. Although we are using a PIN number system, the team is still considering the option of using passwords instead to make the application more secure and lower the risk of the user’s financial information to be compromised.
