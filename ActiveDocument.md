##Vision
  Our product is designed to provide a budgeting mobile application for all people from college students to adults keep track of their day to day expenses in order to help make a budget. 
  Our product will have an user-friendly interface in order to encourage users to use the app often to enter in all expenses and incomes.
  This will allow users to get an accurate representation of what their spending was in a given time period as well as providing insight of which categories they are overspending in.
  The user will be able to view all the expenses and incomes in a transaction log and be able to sort the log in various ways in order to get further insights into their budget.
  The application will also help the user make their monthly budget by constantly displaying how much current money they have to spend in each category.
  As an extra feature to further help users make smarter purchase decisions, the application will provide tips and goals to the user that will encourage the user to spend their money in a more efficient manner.
  Through all these goals and features, we want our users to be able and encouraged to record every income/expense in order to keep a better track of the user's money.
##Configuration Management Plan
  Our team plans to use Github as the main source of Configuration Management. We will use Github to store all our documents and application files.  We will also use Google Docs for documents in certain instances where we want to actively see what another use is working on.
##Process Model
  Our team plans on using the phase development model in order to structure our app in a way that allows many features to be added.  We plan on first developing an app with a basic features of adding incomes and expenses and creating a transaction log.
  In our next development, we aim to add the login feature and ability to sort the transaction in basic ways.  
  After that in our final development, we plan to flesh out everything with the application design, and add the tips/goals system to the app.
  After this development, our app aims to still be structured to easily handle and further features that we wish to add.
##Deliverables

##Potential Risks
  Since our application involves money and purchase history of users, there will be various risks.
  1. There is a risk that a user loses their mobile device, and therefore someone else can access their purchase history.
  2. There is also a liability issue that users may use the information provided in the application and use our application as a reason for going under their budget.
  3. There is a time risk in our process as most of team members are still new to mobile development and may come across some unexpected issues to delay iterations of our development.
  4. There is a human error risk in our application since the information is not verified by anyone past the user.  So if the user inputs incorrect data entries or forgets to add expenses in, the budget summaries will become incorrect.
